# PD_Digital_Controller
Part of a project for a Modern Control Theory class in which a Proportional Derivative (PD) controller had to be designed for a digital control system given a list of design specifications.
The controller was designed to meet two different sets of specifications in order to compare the step response between the two designs. The control system is a PD cascade-compensated system with an A/D (Analog to Digital) and D/A (Digital to Analog) converter.
The controller was also compared with an uncompensated version of the system.

The MATLAB implemenation includes files:
-project1a.m (for PD design according to the first set of specifications)
-project1b.m (for PD design according to the second set of specifications)

The full design procedure and a more in-depth descriptions are listed in EENG720_Project_1.pdf.
